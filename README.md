# cosmological-beckett

This repositiory is for Beckett Cummings Reed thesis 2019 - '20
in which we are working on elementary problems of filaments
in introductory cosmological simulations.  The original motivation
for this project was Nir Mandelker's talk at the UCSC Galaxy 
Workshop 2019.  We are following the physics of filaments presented
in Nir's recent papers.
